        <p>BAGUIO CITY – Stakeholders in the hotel and restaurant industry here are confident that the holidays next week will further help shorten the local tourism industry’s projected recovery period from the impact of the coronavirus disease 2019 (Covid-19) pandemic.

            Hotel and Restaurant Association of Baguio (HRAB) spokesperson Andrew Pinero said accommodation establishments like homestays and transient houses are expecting a brisk business, with many are 90 percent booked while others are already fully booked.
            
            “We are bracing ourselves for the very long weekend,” he told the Philippine News Agency on Monday.

            
            Pinero, who is also the client and members relation manager of the Baguio Country Club, said the projected five-year recovery period for hotels and other accommodation establishments here has been shortened to three years following the revenge travel experienced in 2022.
            
            “The year 2022 broke the record in terms of accommodation. This was the time when despite typhoons and during weekdays, we get tourists,” he said.
            
            Pinero said the goal now is not just to recover but also to have the funds that will allow the accommodation establishments to improve their facilities and to continue hiring staff.
            
            “We have about 60 regular employees who have opted to leave the city for good and go back to their provinces and we are filling up their positions. Some of these are management positions,” he added.
            
            The weekend starts from Oct. 28. Malacañang has declared Oct. 30 a non-working day to allow Filipinos to cast their votes in the Barangay and Sangguniang Kabataan Elections (BSKE).
            
            Nov. 1 or All Saints’ Day is a regular holiday while Nov. 2 (All Souls’ Day) is a special holiday. The observance of All Saints’ Day and All Souls’ Day is known as Undas.
            
            Pinero advised the public to check the list of accredited accommodations from the Baguio Tourism Council to prevent them from being victimized by unscrupulous individuals.
            
            “Nakakaiyak iyong nagbayad ka tapos pagdating mo, wala kang matulugan (It’s frustrating to have paid for a space but once you got here, you have nowhere to stay),” he said. (PNA)</p>

        <h1>Faster recovery in Baguio tourism industry seen</h1>
        <img class="profile1" src="https://www.shihoriobata.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/cute-easy-puppy-dog-drawing-2-web.jpg" width="50px" height="50px">

        <p>BAGUIO CITY – The Hotel and Restaurant Association of Baguio (HRAB) on Tuesday said the hotel industry here is now expected to recover from the effects of the pandemic at a much faster rate thanks to the continuous spike in hotel occupancy.

            Andrew Pinero, spokesperson of the HRAB and client relations manager of the only five-star resort in the city, the Baguio Country Club, said accommodation establishments are experiencing high occupancy rates as the city becomes an attractive destination for "revenge tourists" due to its accessibility and cooler climate.
            
            "We are on the road to recovery but now shorter. If we projected at least five years before we can fully recover, now we can say at least three years," said Pinero in an interview.
            
            He said they noticed a 15- to 20-percent increase in the average monthly tourist arrivals based on hotel bookings.
            
            Currently, the average monthly hotel occupancy in the city is 80 percent, even higher than the 60 to 65 percent before the pandemic, he said.
            
            "We are seeing a high tourist arrival rate, especially on weekends which we hope will continue to allow us to recover in full," he said.
            
            During the quarantine period in 2020, the tourism industry posted an estimated PHP1.46 billion in losses. The amount is based on the 540,373 local tourist arrivals from February to May 2019, computed on a daily expenditure of PHP2,700 per person per day.
            
            Pinero added that when the city started a slow but safe opening to tourists, the arrivals started to show an uptrend that continues to this day.
            
            "If this showing will continue, the projection of five years will be cut short," he said.
            
            He said no accomodation establishment has yet reported any recent losses or having a hard time with their businesses. Even transient houses are also experiencing an increase in bookings, he added. (PNA)</p>

        <h1>2023 Cultural Communities Week features indigenous games</h1>
        <img class="profile1" src="https://i.pinimg.com/1200x/d7/1d/1a/d71d1a41b69bbbf2ca2d94b918d86faf.jpg" width="50px" height="50px">

        <p>BAGUIO CITY (PIA) -- Indigenous tribal Filipinos across the country proudly showcased their indigenous Peoples (IP) games in the 2023 Cultural Communities Week (CCW) celebration. 

            The theme of this year's celebration, "Mga Laro ng Salinlahi, Saligang Haligi ng Katutubong Lipi" (Games of Ancestral Heritage, Foundation of Indigenous Culture), aims to emphasize and exhibit traditional indigenous games and sports as a means through which Indigenous Peoples can assert, commemorate, advocate for, and safeguard their diverse cultural heritage and identity, both within the Philippines and globally.
            National Commission on Indigenous Peoples (NCIP) Chairperson Allen Capuyan, during the opening program of 2023 CCW on Monday (July 10), underlined the importance of indigenous games and sports in bringing people together across political, religious, and cultural divides.

            Capuyan said that sports is crucial in bridging the gap between the Indigenous Cultural Communities(ICC)/IPs and the mainstream society, leading to a greater understanding and recognition of one's identity. 

            "It teaches many important values and abolishes social differences as it gives everyone equal opportunities to perform," he said.

            It also provides an opportunity for the public to learn and experience aspects of the IP culture through participation in the various recreational sports activities. 

            “Let us continue to raise awareness about the IPs/ICCs in our country by honoring their contribution and relevance to the nation’s progress and preserving their cultural heritage,” Capuyan enjoined. 

            The showcase of traditional games does not only invigorate the identity of IPs but more importantly, convey their story, shared NCIP-CAR Regional Director Atanacio D. Addog. 

            Gaspar A. Cayat, NCIP Commissioner for CAR and Region 1,  added that it is these indigenous games that “we find our indigenous cultural identity in its purest and most innocent expression – a childlike wonder and love of being an indigenous person.” 

            Philippine Information Agency Director General Jose A. Torres Jr., himself a Subanen from Mindanao, also extends his message of support for the CCW 2023 highlighting the need to preserve the deep culture of IPs not only for the country but the other parts of the world.

            “Ipinapaalala sa atin ng mga katutubong larong ito na maituturing na yaman ng lahing Pilipino ang pagiging bata. Tuloy-tuloy nating ituro sa ating mga anak ang nakagisnan nating kultura na minana natin sa ating mga ninuno," he said.</p>
